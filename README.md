# Brinc Bug Bounty Program
If a bug has been found, please take the time to investigate and report the bug by creating a github `issues` in this repository. Please follow the instructions and fill out all of the fields with as much detail as possible.

Front-end bugs will be any bugs regarding the front end (application) code. Code involving javascript, rpc/api, etc. will be considered "front-end".

Back-end bugs will be any bugs associated to any smart contract issues. These may include any security vulnerabilities such as [these](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/ethernaut), or any other attack vectors that can be identified.

## Bug Bounty Claims
Once a bug report has been investigated and ranked, the bug submitter will be contacted via email/discord. Once the submitter has responded and claimed their reward, the bounty claims will be updated and rewards will be logged into a ledger.

## Bug Bounty Reward
The bug bounty program rewards will be paid out in the form of Brinc Goverance tokens [BRCG]. This token will not be distributed immediately as the implementation is still under development.
In the meantime, there will be an on-chain ledger, written as a smart contract, to log all the userâ€™s rewards. 
The smart contract address is 0xAddressOfRewardRegistry and the list of rewardees can be found (here)[url].
