# Brinc Bug Bounty Program


## Bug Bounty Claims
Once a bug report has been investigated and ranked, the bug submitter will be contacted via email/discord. Once the submitter has responded and claimed their reward, the bounty claims will be updated and rewards will be logged into a ledger.

## Bug Bounty Reward
The bug bounty program rewards will be paid out in the form of Brinc Goverance tokens [BRCG]. This token will not be distributed immediately as the implementation is still under development.
In the meantime, there will be an on-chain ledger, written as a smart contract, to log all the userâ€™s rewards. 
The smart contract address is 0xAddressOfRewardRegistry and the list of rewardees can be found (here)[url].
